What is JDK?

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is one of three core technology packages
used in Java programming, along with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
It's important to differentiate between these three technologies,
as well as understanding how they're connected:

- The JVM is the Java platform component that executes programs.
- The JRE is the on-disk part of Java that creates the JVM.
- The JDK allows developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JVM and JRE.

Developers new to Java often confuse the Java Development Kit
and the Java Runtime Environment. The distinction is that the JDK is a package
of tools for developing Java-based software, whereas the JRE is a package of tools
for running Java code.

The JRE can be used as a standalone component to simply run Java programs,
but it's also part of the JDK. The JDK requires a JRE because running Java programs
is part of developing them.

Technical definition: The JDK is an implementation of the Java platform specification, including compiler and class libraries.

Everyday definition: The JDK is a software package you download in order to create Java-based applications.
