What is Java compiler?

A Java compiler is a compiler for the programming language Java.
The most common form of output from a Java compiler is Java class
files containing platform-neutral Java bytecode, but there are also
compilers that output optimized native machine code for a particular
hardware/operating system combination.

The Java virtual machine (JVM) loads the class files and either interprets
the bytecode or just-in-time compiles it to machine code and then possibly
optimizes it using dynamic compilation.
